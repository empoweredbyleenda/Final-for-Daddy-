**what currently exists?**
A full-stack web application for Snatched Beauties, a body sculpting spa. The application features a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. Key functionalities include a comprehensive catalog of body sculpting services, an advanced booking system integrated with Calendly, and a complete payment flow using Stripe.

The application has also undergone SEO improvements and deployment readiness checks, with all sensitive keys moved to environment variables.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** Assisting the user who is unable to save their work to GitHub due to a Rate Limit Exceeded error appearing on their mobile interface. The agent explained that this is a temporary platform-level restriction due to too many deployment attempts in a short time and is not an error with the code.
*   **Status:** BLOCKED
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** N/A. This is a user action on the platform UI, not a code issue. The agent's role is to guide the user.
*   **User Testing Done:** N. The user is currently blocked by the platform's rate limit from performing the action.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1: User is blocked from saving work to GitHub (Priority: P0)**
    *   **Description:** The user is experiencing a Rate Limit Exceeded error on the deployment screen when attempting to save the project's current state back to their GitHub repository. This is a critical blocker preventing the user from preserving all the completed work.
    *   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has explained that this is a temporary platform block and advised the user to wait for 30-60 minutes before trying the Deploy Your App or Save to GitHub action again.
    *   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Instruct the user to wait for at least 30 minutes.
        2.  Ask the user to try the Deploy Your App or Save to GitHub action again.
        3.  If the error persists, guide the user to contact Emergent support directly via Discord () or email (), as it is a platform issue.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Resolving this allows the user to permanently save all development progress to their GitHub repository, preventing data loss.
    *   **Status:** BLOCKED
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** N/A
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** No.

**In progress Task List**:
*   None. All development tasks for the user's requests in this session have been completed.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1 (P1): Implement SMS Notifications:**
        *   The user requested SMS functionality. An integration playbook for Twilio was fetched but not implemented.
        *   **Action:** Ask the user for their Twilio credentials (Account SID, Auth Token, Twilio phone number) and implement backend logic in  to send SMS notifications for events like successful booking or payment.
    *   **Task 2 (P2): Implement Automated Email Notifications:**
        *   The original plan included email automation, but this has not been implemented beyond updating the display email address.
        *   **Action:** Use the  agent to get a playbook for an email service (e.g., SendGrid). Ask the user for the necessary API key and implement backend logic to send confirmation emails.

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Stripe & Calendly Integration:** Integrated Stripe for payments with user's test keys and Calendly for bookings.
*   **Service & Content Overhaul:** Aligned all services, pricing, and descriptions with the user's actual body sculpting business (, ).
*   **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Removed gradients and standardized on a solid pink color scheme.

**All files of reference**
*   : Core backend logic, including service definitions, Stripe integration, and API endpoints.
*   : Frontend component for displaying the list of services with hide/show price logic.
*   : Manages the multi-step booking and payment flow.
*   : Contains the frontend environment variables, including .
*   : Contains backend environment variables, including  and .
*   : Process management configuration file that was fixed.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The service data is hardcoded in . While this works, a more robust solution would be to move this data into its own collection in the MongoDB database, allowing for easier management without code changes.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Detailed health check for the backend, database, and Stripe configuration.
*   : Retrieves the list of all available services.
*   : Retrieves details for a single service.
*   : Creates a new Stripe checkout session for a selected service.
*   : Endpoint to receive and handle events from Stripe.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **The user is currently blocked.** Your first task is to help the user resolve the Rate Limit Exceeded error so they can save their work to GitHub. This is a platform issue, not a code issue. Guide them to wait and retry, or contact support.
*   All development work requested by the user in this session is complete and ready to be saved.
*   The application uses user-provided **Stripe test keys**, which are correctly configured in the  files. Do not change them.
*   The UI must not contain any **gradient colors**. The brand color is a solid pink ().
*   The service data, pricing, and descriptions have been meticulously updated based on user feedback. Do not revert these changes.
