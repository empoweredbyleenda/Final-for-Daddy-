**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was manually performing a comprehensive health check to confirm the application is ready for deployment. This was a workaround because the  failed with an error. The check involved verifying environment files, service status, API endpoints, the production build, and database connectivity.
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: Y
    - Which testing method agent to use? NA
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1:  fails when called (Priority: P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: The agent bypassed the issue by running a comprehensive manual health check instead. The root cause of the sub-agent failure was not investigated.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        - Review the 's implementation or internal templates to understand why it throws a  error.
        - Verify if the agent invocation syntax is correct.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: To enable smooth, automated deployments and health checks in the future, removing the need for manual workarounds.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? N/A (This is a tool-level issue)
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **P0: Integrate a real booking system:** The Book Now buttons currently link to the old website's booking page. This should be updated to a new or integrated booking solution.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Axios
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Motor (async MongoDB driver), Pydantic
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Supervisor for process management in a containerized environment.

**key DB schema**
  - : 
  - : 

**changes in tech stack**
  - None.

**All files of reference**
- **Created/Updated:**
    - : Assembled all new components and added routes for the landing page.
    - : Added new Pydantic models and API endpoints for the lead capture system.
    - : A new dedicated page for lead capture.
    - : Major updates to define the new color theme.
    - All other components listed under **Code Architecture** were created to build the new site.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Backend:**  is becoming a monolith. Routes and models should be split into separate files/modules for better maintainability as the application grows.

**key api endpoints**
- : Creates a new lead and returns a coupon code.
- : Retrieves all captured leads.
- : Basic backend health check.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user gives iterative visual feedback. Be prepared to make design adjustments based on specific requests (e.g., color changes, layout tweaks).
- The automated  is currently unreliable and fails. Use manual health checks as a fallback to verify deployment readiness.
- The lead capture functionality is live, but the main website content (services, testimonials) is still populated from .

**documents and test_reports created in this job**
- None.
